# Backend Data Capture and Telemetry Enhancements

## Objectives
- Capture structured session activity for telemetry and compliance purposes.
- Provide secure backend storage and analytics for form-state snapshots and metrics.
- Enforce data retention, privacy, and access control policies.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design an event schema for UI interactions (field edits, para additions, generation attempts) and instrument the front end to emit events.
- [ ] Implement background delivery of events via `navigator.sendBeacon` or resilient `fetch` calls to a hardened ingestion endpoint.
- [ ] Build a backend ingestion service (e.g., Cloudflare Workers, Azure Function) that validates, stores, and secures incoming events.
- [ ] Offer opt-in form-state snapshot syncing to a compliant document store (Cosmos DB, DynamoDB, PostgreSQL JSONB) with encryption-at-rest.
- [ ] Develop analytics pipelines (Kafka Streams, Kinesis Analytics, etc.) that derive KPIs from captured events.
- [ ] Create dashboards exposing metrics such as completion time, validation failures, and risk trends to authorised stakeholders.
- [ ] Log template usage and remediation playbook selections for version tracking and A/B testing.
- [ ] Implement retention, redaction, export, and purge capabilities aligned with compliance policies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Telemetry events are captured reliably without degrading user experience.
- Backend storage and analytics pipelines operate securely with role-based access controls.
- Administrators can manage data retention and access logs in accordance with regulations.

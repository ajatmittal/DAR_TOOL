# Document Templating and Extensibility Enhancements

## Objectives
- Decouple DOCX templates from the application bundle and support managed template updates.
- Create reusable WordprocessingML mapping utilities with clear documentation.
- Prepare the system for multiple template variants and safer template maintenance.

## Tasks
- [ ] Externalise the DOCX template into configurable assets that can be uploaded or selected at runtime.
- [ ] Build a template manager interface with metadata tracking (version, checksum, page settings, locale).
- [ ] Implement secure storage and loading mechanisms for template files, including validation of file integrity.
- [ ] Refactor the WordprocessingML merge logic into documented utility modules with unit tests.
- [ ] Map each form field to its target XML node and record the mapping in developer documentation.
- [ ] Support switching between templates and ensure DOCX generation honours the selected version.
- [ ] Provide migration guidance for administrators when new templates are introduced.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Templates can be managed without editing embedded Base64 strings in the codebase.
- Mapping utilities are tested, documented, and reusable across template versions.
- DOCX generation functions correctly with multiple template options.

# Intelligence, Collaboration, and Automation Enhancements

## Objectives
- Provide contextual AI assistance to support drafting and validation activities.
- Enable scenario modelling for forecasting and remediation planning.
- Introduce collaborative workflows and downstream publishing capabilities.

## Tasks
- [ ] Evaluate secure LLM deployment options (self-hosted or API gateway) that satisfy regulatory constraints.
- [ ] Design prompt workflows for summarising paras, suggesting remediation, and detecting inconsistencies.
- [ ] Integrate AI assistance into the UI with clear user controls and audit logs of generated content.
- [ ] Build a scenario-modelling engine capable of adjusting detection, recovery, and revenue forecasts reactively.
- [ ] Embed data visualisations (e.g., charts) that illustrate impacts of “what-if” adjustments.
- [ ] Implement collaborative features for task assignment, approval requests, and status tracking.
- [ ] Choose and integrate a real-time sync mechanism (WebRTC, SignalR, Pusher, etc.) for multi-user editing.
- [ ] Develop connectors to document management systems (SharePoint, Alfresco) for automated publishing of outputs.
- [ ] Ensure all new features include security, privacy, and compliance safeguards with appropriate documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- AI assistance operates within compliance boundaries and supports analysts without leaking sensitive data.
- Scenario modelling tools provide actionable insights and update the UI responsively.
- Collaborative workflows and publishing integrations streamline multi-analyst review processes.

# Quality Assurance and Tooling Enhancements

## Objectives
- Establish automated testing coverage for critical calculations and workflows.
- Provide diagnostics that help reproduce and debug failures in the field.
- Ensure continuous integration enforces build quality and distributable integrity.

## Tasks
- [ ] Identify core calculation paths (detection/recovery totals, nested tables, dashboard aggregations) and design unit tests for each.
- [ ] Create integration or end-to-end tests (Playwright/Cypress) that exercise DOCX generation and key UI flows.
- [ ] Configure testing frameworks within the chosen build system and document how to run the suites.
- [ ] Implement structured logging within the app, capturing key events and error states.
- [ ] Provide a mechanism to download diagnostics or debug reports for support teams.
- [ ] Set up a CI pipeline that runs linting, type-checking, tests, and build steps on every change.
- [ ] Publish build artifacts from CI for verification and distribution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Automated tests cover mission-critical calculations and pass reliably.
- Diagnostic information is easily retrievable when failures occur.
- CI pipelines gate merges on linting, testing, and build success.

# User Experience and Accessibility Enhancements

## Objectives
- Provide clear, accessible validation feedback and guidance throughout the workflow.
- Simplify navigation of large forms with progressive disclosure and progress tracking.
- Ensure all interactive controls meet keyboard and screen-reader accessibility requirements.

## Tasks
- [ ] Identify required fields and add semantic indicators (labels, aria attributes, text descriptions) for validation states.
- [ ] Implement an error summary region that aggregates validation issues and links to affected fields.
- [ ] Introduce collapsible or accordion sections for large form groups to reduce cognitive load.
- [ ] Add a progress indicator and pre-flight checklist that blocks export until critical data is complete.
- [ ] Enhance autosave insights or dashboards to highlight missing revenue or remediation data.
- [ ] Audit para reordering, risk-table editing, and notification flows for keyboard operability.
- [ ] Add aria-live regions and focus management for toast notifications and dynamic updates.
- [ ] Conduct accessibility testing (manual and automated) to ensure WCAG compliance targets are met.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users receive accessible, text-based validation cues in addition to colour changes.
- Form navigation is streamlined with collapsible sections and progress tracking.
- Keyboard-only and screen-reader users can complete all workflows without barriers.
